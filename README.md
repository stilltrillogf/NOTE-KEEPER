# NOTE-KEEPER

## Description

I want to make a note keeping app to learn new concepts, reinforce my knowledge and slowly build out my software developement portfolio.
Also, I need this sort of app for personal usage.
Making it myself will allow me to customize it and add features that popular note keeping apps lack.
